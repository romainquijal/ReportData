This project was built to showcase a use case: displaying a report inside a Lightning page and dynamically filtering it with the current record and some parameters.

Here is an example of the LWC in action:

Parameters are accessible through the Lightning App Builder, allowing each LWC to operate autonomously.

Please note that this application can handle a maximum of 2000 records.

Joined reports are not supported.
